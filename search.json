    "text": "Overview on how to create a FAIR Implementation Profile\nThe FIP Wizard 4.0 is by now a stable and robust tool. However, as the FIP Wizard generates and relies on information that is open to the community at large, it requires some expert guidance in its use in order to ensure the quality of the output. This means that anyone who wishes to create a FIP should ﬁrst participate in a FIP Introduction workshop conducted by a GFF qualiﬁed 3PFF facilitator. A major responsibility of the 3PFF facilitator is to curate newly created FERs to ensure the list of resources is uncluttered by duplicates or erroneous and useless nanopublications. If you are interested in GFF qualiﬁcation as a 3PFF facilitator, please email fipadmin@gofair.foundation.\nMaking a FIP will typically involve three activities summarized below. The numbered chapters of this user guide will provide all the details you need to operate the FIP Wizard responsibly and with conﬁdence.\n\nCompleting the FIP Ǫuestionnaire: Answer the questions of the FIP Wizard questionnaire by selecting for each FAIR Principle, the FAIR Enabling Resources from the drop-down lists, setting the implementation status, and stating your considerations behind that choice. Go to Getting started and Completing the FIP!\nMinting New Nanopublications: When declaring your community as a FAIR Implementation Community (FIC) or when selecting FERs keep in mind that:\n\nOther communities may have provided answers that in some cases are not yet quality-checked by experts (those that have been checked are marked with a GFF badge).\nWhen the FICs and FERs you are looking for can not be found in the drop-down lists, you’ll have to mint new FICs and FERs as nanopublications (go to Minting nanopublications).\n\nA few notes:\n\nMany resources might be already described in FAIRsharing, in which case you should reuse the metadata recorded in there.\nTypically, FERs of type Metadata-data-linking-mechanism (F3), Communication-protocol (A1.1), Authentication & Authorization Techniques (A1.2), a Knowledge-representation-language (I1) or Usage-license (R1.1) need to be described from scratch. This is true as well for “new” resources and “resources in development”.\nMinting new FERs with good metadata as nanopubs requires a deep understanding about the resource and the FER types to which it is assigned.\n\nFIP Publication: The FIP Wizard (the FIP Ǫuestionnaire and its drop-down lists and nanopublication features) can be seen as an editing tool, assisting you in the creation of your FIP. During the creation process and after you have completed your FIP, you can always search for your FIP within the “Project” list of the FIP Wizard, and view and revise it as you like. However, to make a deﬁnitive FIP that will be recognized by the community (including machines), you must also publish your FIP. This can also be done from the FIP Wizard, and involves a two-step process where you must ﬁrst compile the list of nanopublications as a single document (a trig ﬁle) and then submit this list to the FIP server (see Publishing)."

    "text": "Background\nSemantic interoperability (SI) is at the heart of the FAIR principles and of the design of large scale cross disciplinary infrastructures. The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) is a European-wide effort towards such an infrastructure. The EOSC Semantic Interoperability Task Force is focusing on recommendations for SI (EOSC SI Task Force) with the ambition to converge on globally relevant and scalable SI solutions for EOSC.\nTaking into account new developments and ongoing efforts in the field, we want to interview semantic or data management experts involved in cluster projects, EOSC projects, or research infrastructures. With this interview series, we do not claim to be able to provide a statistically relevant base but rather aim at a qualitative, in-depth analysis of the implementation landscape across communities. By providing the answers to the survey you will contribute to a collectively created knowledge base. As this is not a usual survey but a collective kind of editing process we need you to claim ownership about your contributions and, hence, answers are not anonymized. This survey was preceded by a first test run during the summer period 2023 (July and August) to get feedback from interviewees about the questionnaire, which included only questions requiring text-based answers. The current survey is based on the FIP ontology resulting in machine-readable output from the answers provided.\nBased on the answers given by the interviewees in the first run, i.e. the FAIR Supporting Resources (FSRs) like metadata schemas or semantic artifacts used by communities, the team created machine and human-readable nanopublications that can then be reused in the questionnaire. Additionally, the analysis of the survey will lead to recommendations for projects like FAIRCORE4EOSC and FAIR-Impact on how to implement SI in practice. Find more information about the task force activity in this publication.\nWe would like to invite you to complete the survey together with the interviewer. We expect answering all questions in the consultation should take around 60 minutes.\nPlease be aware that you will be asked specific questions in these three sections:\n\nGeneral information: In this first chapter you will describe the focus of the targeted data for which you provide more details in the follow up section\nDetails on semantic interoperability: Here you are supposed to provide insights into challenges and solutions in the use of combined datasets.\n\nIf your community provides data of a different digital object type and semantic interoperable case study we ask you to clone this project and modify it only where needed in order to make your answers unambiguous.\nWe thank you for completing the survey. Feedback from the EOSC community is needed to help fine-tune the approach towards this very crucial question for the future of EOSC! If you have any comments, questions or suggestions on how to improve the FIP Wizard experience, please contact us: fipadmin@gofair.foundation.\nDISCLAIMER\nThe Task Force will share publicly the responses and comments obtained. Authorship is acknowledged by your ORCID used in the nanopublication provenance.\nThe European Commission is not responsible for the content of questionnaires created using the EUSurvey service - it remains the sole responsibility of the form creator and manager. The use of EUSurvey service does not imply a recommendation or endorsement, by the European Commission, of the views expressed within them.\nHence, this user guide is designed to complement the SIP-specific features of the Wizard environment. Details on more generic features of the Wizard (e.g., how to create, save, version projects) can be found in the DSW User Guide.",

    "text": "Background\nA FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) is a list of declared technology choices, also referred to as  FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs), that are intended to implement one or more of the FAIR Guiding Principles, made as a collective decision by the members of a particular community of practice. These guidelines provide a practical, “how to” overview for researchers and data stewards who wish to create a FIP using the FIP Wizard 4.0. For general background on the FIP, see Schultes et al. (2020).\nThe FIP Wizard 4.0 tool is based on the same technology as the familiar Data Stewardship Wizard. Essentially, we have replaced the Knowledge Model that guides the creation of a data stewardship plan, with a Knowledge Model based on the FIP Questionnaire that guides the user in the creation of a FIP. We have also added the capability for the FIP Wizard 4.0 to use (consume and produce) nanopublications, allowing the various elements of the FIP to be captured in this highly modular, referenceable, machine-interpretable format. Making use of nanopublications and the FIP Ontology, the FIP Wizard 4.0 captures FIPs that are themselves, to a very high degree, FAIR. \nHence, this user guide is designed to complement the FIP-specific features of the Wizard environment. Details on more generic features of the Wizard (e.g., how to create, save, version projects) can be found in the DSW User Guide. \nWhy FIPs anyways?\n\nA FIP can be compiled to declare both the current and the future use of FERs in a community.\nA FIP can be compiled to declare specifically the current status of implementations within a community (called the AS-IS FIPs). This declaration can also sometimes be useful in guiding data stewards working in that community. \nA FIP can be compiled to decide on the future use of FERs in a community (called the TO-BE FIPs). These FIPs can be used to document technology trends in FAIR. \nIt is likely that any given FIP will need periodic revision. In this case, each new version documents improvements in FAIR over time. \nAny given FIP can be compared with FIPs from other communities giving insight on how FIPs might be optimized to ensure FAIR Convergence.  \n\nThe FIP Wizard team is composed of Barbara Magagna, Marek Suchanek, Tobias Kuhn, and Erik Schultes. We wish you success in composing your FIP.

We have also added the capability for the FIP Wizard 4.0 to use (consume and produce) nanopublications, allowing the various elements of the FIP to be captured in this highly modular, referenceable, machine-interpretable format. Making use of nanopublications and the FIP Ontology, the FIP Wizard 4.0 captures FIPs that are themselves, to a very high degree, FAIR. \nHence, this user guide is designed to complement the FIP-specific features of the Wizard environment. Details on more generic features of the Wizard (e.g., how to create, save, version projects) can be found in the DSW User Guide. \nWhy FIPs anyways?\n\nA FIP can be compiled to declare both the current and the future use of FERs in a community.\nA FIP can be compiled to declare specifically the current status of implementations within a community (called the AS-IS FIPs). This declaration can also sometimes be useful in guiding data stewards working in that community. \nA FIP can be compiled to decide on the future use of FERs in a community (called the TO-BE FIPs). These FIPs can be used to document technology trends in FAIR. \nIt is likely that any given FIP will need periodic revision. In this case, each new version documents improvements in FAIR over time. \nAny given FIP can be compared with FIPs from other communities giving insight on how FIPs might be optimized to ensure FAIR Convergence.  \n\nThe FIP Wizard team is composed of Barbara Magagna, Marek Suchanek, Tobias Kuhn, and Erik Schultes. We wish you success in composing your FIP. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions on how to improve the FIP Wizard experience, please contact us: fipadmin@gofair.foundation."

    "text": "Minting nanopublications\nWhat is a nanopublication?\nA nanopublication is a unitary assertion about the world with associated metadata, rendered in machine-readable form, and all of this having a globally unique, persistent and resolvable identifier (see here and here).\n\n\n\nNanopublications are authored using cryptographic keys that make them hard to forge and corrupt. So once published, they are persistent and immutable.\nMultiple nanopublications can be “contained” or bundled using a special kind of nanopublication called “index nanopublications”.\nWhy nanopublication?\n\nThese computational properties of nanopublications can be powerfully leveraged to make machine-readable FIPs.\nThis happens in two ways:\n\nIndividual components of the FIP (such as the FIC and FERs) are all represented as nanopublications.\nThe output of the FIP Wizard 3.0 (see Publishing your FIP) is an index nanopublication that provides a list of declared FERs for every FIC.\n\n\nHow to mint FER nanopublications in the FIP Wizard\n\nGo to VII. Register a new resource as a nanopublication\nClick on one of the four “template” links\nThis takes you to a new project dialog box.\nSelect the tab: From Template\nEnter a name for your new nanopub. There is no speciﬁc format required here for the name.\nClick Save. This will bring you to the questionnaire.\nThere are only two chapters:\n\nAuthor - provide your ORCID.\nDeﬁnition - various details required to build your nanopublication. For Communities you may choose a “supercommunity” to which your community belongs which will help in the analysis of the results. For FERs you have to identify the appropriate FER type. More than one FER type can apply. A FER might be available or ‘to be developed’.\n\nFor the name of the resource you are creating you should avoid ‘,’ use a pipe (|) with a space before and after that symbol (for enabling a better ﬁndability) if you want to add both an acronym and a longer name like Envthes | Environmental Thesaurus\nAfter completing the project, go to Documents (15) and make a new document.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Template choose Nanopublication Template and for Format choose RDF Trig.\nPush Create.\nIf no error appears you can submit the nanopub clicking on the three dots (16):\nChoose Nanopub Server (not the local one, which is only for testing) and submit.\nClick on view submission.\n\nYou will see the submission as a FER nanopub (17), the persistent identiﬁer (nanopub URI) is highlighted in yellow.\n\n\n\nThis FER will now appear, automatically, in the drop downs of the question where the FER type is expected (e.g. identiﬁer for F1).\nThe newly created FER will not yet have a GFF qualiﬁcation, as this review process will take a few days. If it is not accepted you will get a notiﬁcation about the reason.\nYou can, however, already use the FER before it gets a qualiﬁcation."

    "text": "Completing the FIP questionnaire\nThe FIP questionnaire has 29 questions (referred to in the FIP ontology as “declarations”), divided among 7 chapters.\n    I. About\n    II. Declare your FAIR Implementation Community\n    III. Declarations for Findability\n    IV. Declarations for Accessibility\n    V. Declarations for Interoperability\n    VI. Declarations for Reusability\n    VII. Register a new resource as a nanopublication\nOn the left, the FIP Wizard displays a questionnaire navigation tool, indicating the chapters and the number of questions that still need to be answered for each chapter (10).\n\n\n\nIf you click on any chapter in the navigation tool all questions of that chapter will be displayed. Clicking on any question on the left will automatically lead you to that question in the central area of the Wizard.\nIn the questionnaire, questions that have been answered will be highlighted in green, and those that still need to be answered will be highlighted in red. The FIP Wizard will use the resulting FIP as the definitive answer for R1.3 (domain-relevant community standards).\nChapter I. About, gives some background information but has no associated questions.\nChapter II. Declare your FAIR Implementation Community (FIC) (11)\nThis chapter contains these questions:\n\nIdentify your FIC by using the drop-down / autocomplete functions in the text box. If you do not see your community, you’ll have to first mint a nanopublication representing your community (see below).\nIdentify the person who will be responsible for completing the FIP questionnaire (the community data steward) using ORCID.\nOptionally provide the type of digital object you are focusing on in this FIP.\nOptionally provide an accessible identifier of one of your digital objects of the chosen type.\nOptionally provide a link (OSF or Zenodo DOI) to a case study description you want to focus on in this FIP.\nStart date of the validity of the FIP.\nEnd date of the validity of the FIP. It may be the case that an explicit end date has yet to be specified by your community, in this case answer with “December 31 2050”.\n\n\n\n\nThe F, A, I and R chapters have a series of questions that follow the same format. The explanatory help text throughout these chapters builds upon Jacobsen et al (2020) “FAIR Principles: Interpretations and Implementation Considerations” and reflects also the GO FAIR Foundation’s interpretations which can be accessed at the GO FAIR Foundation’s website: https://www.gofair.foundation/interpretation. This link should help you to understand precisely what type of FAIR Enabling Resource (FER) is being asked for in each case, and for what purpose. Note, in most cases, identical questions are repeated specifically addressing that issue for both data and metadata. In total, there are 12 different FER types, but a FER might be of more than one type (a metadata scheme can also include provenance information and therefore be a FER for F2 and R1.2).\nThere is a common pattern for each of the questions referring to each FAIR Principles. The questions begin by asking you to make an explicit declaration, about the usage of FAIR Enabling Resources regarding that Principle within your community.\nIf your community uses a resource that is not FAIR, you have two options:\n\nIn case your community is not in control of the resource, choose option a. No Implementations choice and add the resource as free text in the Considerations box (12).\nIn case your community is in control of the resource and plans to FAIRify it, choose Declaration: FAIR Enabling Resource(s), and define that you are going to use it in future (see below).\n\n\n\n\nIf your community uses a resource that has some level of FAIRness, then click option b. and add (declare) the FAIR Enabling Resource (or a list of resources) by clicking the +Add button (13).\n\n\n\n\nThe questionnaire asks you to select (from the drop-down list) a FER for that particular FAIR Principle (14).\n\n\n\n\nNote: those items in the list that are marked with the GFF qualification logo are quality-checked by the GO FAIR team\n\n\n\nOthers without badges have not yet been quality-checked.\n\nYour selection has a follow-up question regarding the usage status of that FER in your community. Is the FER:\n\nCurrently in use by the community,\nCurrently in use, but is planned to be replaced in the future,\nIs planned to be used in the future.\n\n\nAnswering b will open another text box, allowing you to select the replacement FER.\nLastly, there is a free-text box where you may record the considerations behind your declared choices. These are typically the requirements and constraints your community has identified that factor into the implementation.\nAdd additional FERs if necessary by clicking the Add + button and repeating the cycle.\nChapter VII. Register a new resource as a nanopublication\nThere are 3 cases where you will need to mint a new nanopublication before you can complete the FIP questionnaire:\n\ncreating a new FAIR Implementation Community (FIC),\ncreating a new FAIR Enabling Resource (FER): either by using metadata from FAIRsharing or by creating a new metadata,\ncreating a Metadata Preservation Policy (MPP).\n\nBy clicking on the “template” link in each case, you will be taken to the dialog box for creating a new project - in this case, a new Wizard project template for authoring nanopublications.\nOnce you have successfully created a new nanopublication, it will become immediately visible (and selectable) to you and others in the appropriate drop-down lists of the FIP Wizard 3.0."
