We are migrating the production environment of the **FIP Wizard** to a new URL. Starting **May 14**, the service will be available at: [https://fip.fair-wizard.com](https://fip.fair-wizard.com)

**Key Dates:**

**May 13**: The current FIP/FSR submission service will be temporarily unavailable during the transition.

**May 14**: The new [FIP Wizard instance](https://fip.fair-wizard.com/) goes live.

**June 4**: The current [(old) instance](https://fip-wizard.ds-wizard.org/) will be fully decommissioned.

**Between May 14 and June 4**, you can still access the old FIP Wizard to manually transfer any projects that are not yet available in the new instance. However, please note that the old platform **can no longer be used** to create new projects or generate documents.

**All your projects with published documents** (like FIPS or FSRs) **are being securely transferred to the new instance**. You will be able to access them using your existing login credentialsâ€”**no action is required on your part**. 
However, be aware that empty and test projects will not be transferred.

If you have a **project without a published document** that you want to ensure gets transferred automatically to the new instance, please add its URL to this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1293H4TsuRvarwyZwTch5gEiaMu29gXVC-lvd909yQno/edit?gid=0#gid=0) at latest by **Monday, May 12**.

**After May 14**, if you cannot find your project in the new instance, you can still **manually transfer your projects** by following these instructions:
Go to your project and publish a new document as JSON. More specifically, click Documents > New Document with Document Template Questionnaire Report and format JSON Data. Once created, click on the three dots symbol and press Download. In the new instance you create a new project using the same project template and click on *import replies* (right under the questionnaire at the top) and import that JSON file. All content will be imported.  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to us at fipadmin@gofair.foundation.
