FIPs can be represented as pure RDF output: at the moment this requires some manual concatenating of two strings to a URI, but we are implementing this as additional feature in the FIP Wizard.

The **manual URI generation** works as follows:

you need to concatenate two strings to a uri, where the first string is to be reused as it is and the second is the last part of the FIP URI:

(first part) *https://grlc.knowledgepixels.com/api-git/knowledgepixels/fairconnect-api/get_fip_rdf?fipnp=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fnp%2F*

PLUS

(last part of FIP URI) *RA92EUwxXCV8AkRwecLl09mllK1kipomZqPPAgJ8G4oN0*

**To get RDF**: *https://grlc.knowledgepixels.com/api-git/knowledgepixels/fairconnect-api/get_fip_rdf?fipnp=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fnp%2FRA92EUwxXCV8AkRwecLl09mllK1kipomZqPPAgJ8G4oN0*

**To get JSON-LD**: Adding *&format=application/ld+json* to your string will get you a JSON-LD output

**How to get to your FIP URI**:

Once you created a nanopublication for your FIP in the Wizard, you should go to submission:

Then you see the full nanopublication: you can easily copy the required part of the URI from the address bar (highlighted in orange).
