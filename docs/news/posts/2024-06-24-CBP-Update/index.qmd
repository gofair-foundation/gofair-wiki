GO FAIR Foundation has updated its **GFF Capacity Building Programme**.

We introduced a new level for qualification for those wanting to learn
the content of the CBP but not interested to become facilitators or
trainers themselves. They can participate in the same training units but
omit the assistance time (so in total spend 60 hours instead of 80
hours) and be qualified as Implementers.

The two modules are renamed into:

**Module 1**:

-   Unit FAIR Awareness

-   Unit FAIR Implementation Profile

-   Unit M4M introduction

Three possible qualifications:

-   **FIP Implementer** (after 60 hours training and exam)

-   **FIP Facilitator** (after 40 hours training, exam and 20 hours
    assistance)

-   **3PFF Faciltitor** (after 60 hours training, exam and 20 hours
    assistance)

**Module 2**, only possible after completing Module 1:

-   Unit M4M vocabulary

-   Unit M4M metadata

-   Unit FAIR orchestration

Two possible qualifications:

-   **M4M Implementer** (after 60 hours training and exam)

-   **3PFF Trainer** (after 60 hours training, exam and 20 hours
    assistance)
