Dear Fellows!

We are delighted to announce that our next Fellows Day will be held on 23 September (afternoon) at the GFF office in Leiden. This special event is an opportunity for us to come together, share experiences, strengthen our community and celebrate achievements by awarding certificates to those who have successfully completed their courses. Hopefully, this will motivate a few more people to speed up and finish in time â€“ 16 September is the last day to submit your completion declaration before the event. Please contact me if you have any doubts about what is needed to finish the course!

The programme will include an overview of our achievements over the last six months and our ongoing projects. You are welcome to present your own work or suggest ideas for collaboration. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PpuzwZ8fVpkL4zd_69nrp5moXlEPaOAmP8ViBEHQEQ/edit?tab=t.0) the full agenda

Warm regards,

Judith (on behalf of Barbara)
