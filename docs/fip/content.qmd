## Background

A FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) is a list of declared technology choices, also referred to as  FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs), that are intended to implement one or more of the FAIR Guiding Principles, made as a collective decision by the members of a particular community of practice. These guidelines provide a practical, "how to" overview for researchers and data stewards who wish to create a FIP using the FIP Wizard 4.0. For general background on the FIP, see Reusable FAIR Implementation Profiles as Accelerators of FAIR Convergence, in Grossmann G., Ram S. (eds) Advances in Conceptual Modeling. ER 2020. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 12584. Springer, Cham. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-65847-2_13). 

The FIP Wizard 4.0 tool is based on the same technology as the familiar [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/dsw-story). Essentially, we have replaced the Knowledge Model that guides the creation of a data stewardship plan, with a Knowledge Model based on the FIP Questionnaire that guides the user in the creation of a FIP. We have also added the capability for the FIP Wizard 4.0 to use (consume and produce) [nanopublications](https://nanopub.net), allowing the various elements of the FIP to be captured in this highly modular, referenceable, machine-interpretable format. Making use of nanopublications and the [FIP Ontology](https://w3id.org/fair/fip), the FIP Wizard 4.0 captures FIPs that are themselves, to a very high degree, FAIR. 

Hence, this user guide is designed to complement the FIP-specific features of the Wizard environment. Details on more generic features of the Wizard (e.g., how to create, save, version projects) can be found in the [DSW User Guide](https://guide.ds-wizard.org). 

**Why FIPs anyways?**

-   A FIP can be compiled to declare both the current and the future use of FERs in a community.

-   A FIP can be compiled to declare specifically the current status of implementations within a community (called the AS-IS FIPs). This declaration can also sometimes be useful in guiding data stewards working in that community. 

-   A FIP can be compiled to decide on the future use of FERs in a community (called the TO-BE FIPs). These FIPs can be used to document technology trends in FAIR. 

-   It is likely that any given FIP will need periodic revision. In this case, each new version documents improvements in FAIR over time. 

-   Any given FIP can be compared with FIPs from other communities giving insight on how FIPs might be optimized to ensure FAIR Convergence.  

The FIP Wizard team is composed of Barbara Magagna, Marek Suchanek, Tobias Kuhn, and Erik Schultes. We wish you success in composing your FIP. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions on how to improve the FIP Wizard experience, please contact us: fipadmin\@gofair.foundation.

## Overview on how to create a FAIR Implementation Profile

The FIP Wizard 4.0 is by now a stable and robust tool. However, as the FIP Wizard generates and relies on information that is open to the community at large, it requires some expert guidance in its use in order to ensure the quality of the output. This means that anyone who wishes to create a FIP should ﬁrst participate in a FIP Introduction workshop conducted by a **GFF qualiﬁed** [3PFF facilitator](https://osf.io/bthf8). A major responsibility of the 3PFF facilitator is to curate newly created FERs to ensure the list of resources is uncluttered by duplicates or erroneous and useless nanopublications. If you are interested in GFF qualiﬁcation as a 3PFF facilitator, please email fipadmin\@gofair.foundation.

Making a FIP will typically involve three activities summarized below. The numbered chapters of this user guide will provide all the details you need to operate the FIP Wizard responsibly and with conﬁdence.

1.  **Completing the FIP Ǫuestionnaire:** Answer the questions of the FIP Wizard questionnaire by selecting for each FAIR Principle, the FAIR Enabling Resources from the drop-down lists, setting the implementation status, and stating your considerations behind that choice. Go to [Getting started](https://gofair-foundation.github.io/fip/GettingStarted.html) and [Completing the FIP](https://gofair-foundation.github.io/fip/Completing.html)!

2.  **Creating New Nanopublications:** When declaring your community as a FAIR Implementation Community (FIC) or when selecting FERs keep in mind that:

    -   Other communities may have provided answers that in some cases are not yet quality-checked by experts (those that have been checked are marked with a GFF badge).
    -   When the FICs and FERs you are looking for can not be found in the drop-down lists, you’ll have to create new FICs and FERs as nanopublications (go to [Creating nanopublications](https://gofair-foundation.github.io/fip/MintingNanopublications.html)).

    A few notes:

    -   Many resources might be already described in [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/), in which case you should reuse the metadata recorded in there.
    -   Typically, FERs of type Metadata-data-linking-mechanism (F3), Communication-protocol (A1.1), Authentication & Authorization Techniques (A1.2), a Knowledge-representation-language (I1) or Usage-license (R1.1) need to be described from scratch. This is true as well for “new” resources and “resources in development”.
    -   Creating new FERs with good metadata as nanopubs requires a deep understanding about the resource and the [FER types](https://osf.io/2f9ej) to which it is assigned.

3.  **FIP Publication:** The FIP Wizard (the FIP Ǫuestionnaire and its drop-down lists and nanopublication features) can be seen as an editing tool, assisting you in the creation of your FIP. During the creation process and after you have completed your FIP, you can always search for your FIP within the “Project” list of the FIP Wizard, and view and revise it as you like. However, to make a deﬁnitive FIP that will be recognized by the community (including machines), you must also publish your FIP. This can also be done from the FIP Wizard, and involves a two-step process where you must ﬁrst compile the list of nanopublications as a single document (a trig ﬁle) and then submit this list to the FIP server (see [Publishing](https://gofair-foundation.github.io/fip/Publishing.html)).

## Getting started with the FIP Wizard 4.0

-   Go to https://fip-wizard.ds-wizard.org: log in or sign up.
-   Click Projects (a folder icon in the menu bar on the left) (1).

<img src="./_static/img/1.png" width="20%"/>

-   You will see a long list of projects on the right (2). FIPs are projects in the FIP Wizard and are normally named by the community that composed them.

<img src="./_static/img/2.png" width="40%"/>

-   You can create FIPs either from scratch or by cloning an existing FIP, and revising it.

**Clone and adapt the FIP project** - By default, you can see only projects you created. To see all projects click on the button where you can see your name and click ‘Clear selection’ (3).

<img src="./_static/img/3.png" width="80%"/>

-   Locate your reference FIP in the list.

-   If the FIP has an orange annotation ‘update available’ click on the three dots on the right (4).

    <img src="./_static/img/4.png" width="80%"/>

    -   Select Create Migration, click create and resolve all. This will update your project with the newest Knowledge Model.
    -   Then click again on the three dots and select Clone (5).

    <img src="./_static/img/5.png" width="30%"/>

    -   This will bring you to the FIP questionnaire. To change the name of the FIP you need to go to Settings (6). You can now start to work with the FIP Wizard questionnaire, and modify the previous FIP declarations (see below).

<img src="./_static/img/6.png" width="40%"/>

**Make a new FIP**

-   Click **Create** (blue button on the top menu bar) (7).

    <img src="./_static/img/7.png" width="100%"/>

-   You’ll see **Create Project** - this dialog box will launch your new FIP (8).

<img src="./_static/img/8.png" width="40%"/>

-   Select the tab: **From Project Template**

-   Enter a name for your FIP: We recommend *\[Community acronym\] FIP* (for better findability avoid using '\_' in the name)

-   Add a short description of the FIP

-   Select the **FIP template** from the drop-down list You’ll see here 4 templates

-   FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP)

-   A FAIR Implementation Community (FIC)

-   A FAIR Enabling Resource from FAIRsharing

-   A FAIR Enabling Resource (FER)

-   Click **Save**. This will bring you to the FIP questionnaire. You can now start to work with the FIP Wizard questionnaire, and make FIP declarations (see below).

Principally there should be one and only one person who acts as a data steward for the community and enters all answers. However, in most cases the answers will need to be agreed upon by an expert team of that community. By clicking on the **Share button** on the top right you can provide editing or viewing rights for your colleagues (9).

<img src="./_static/img/9.png" width="60%"/>

## Completing the FIP questionnaire

The FIP questionnaire has 29 questions (referred to in the FIP ontology as “declarations”), divided among 7 chapters.

    I. About

    II. Declare your FAIR Implementation Community

    III. Declarations for Findability

    IV. Declarations for Accessibility

    V. Declarations for Interoperability

    VI. Declarations for Reusability

    VII. Register a new resource as a nanopublication

On the left, the FIP Wizard displays a questionnaire navigation tool, indicating the chapters and the number of questions that still need to be answered for each chapter (10).

<img src="./_static/img/10.png" width="100%"/>

If you click on any chapter in the navigation tool all questions of that chapter will be displayed. Clicking on any question on the left will automatically lead you to that question in the central area of the Wizard.

In the questionnaire, questions that have been answered will be highlighted in green, and those that still need to be answered will be highlighted in red. The FIP Wizard will use the resulting FIP as the definitive answer for R1.3 (domain-relevant community standards).

**Chapter I. About**, gives some background information but has no associated questions.

**Chapter II. Declare your FAIR Implementation Community (FIC)** (11)

This chapter contains these questions:

1.  Identify your FIC by using the drop-down / autocomplete functions in the text box. If you do not see your community, you’ll have to first create a nanopublication representing your community (see below).

2.  Identify the person who will be responsible for completing the FIP questionnaire (the community data steward) using ORCID.

3.  Optionally provide the type of digital object you are focusing on in this FIP.

4.  Optionally provide an accessible identifier of one of your digital objects of the chosen type.

5.  Optionally provide a link (OSF or Zenodo DOI) to a case study description you want to focus on in this FIP.

6.  Start date of the validity of the FIP.

7.  End date of the validity of the FIP. It may be the case that an explicit end date has yet to be specified by your community, in this case answer with "December 31 2050".

<img src="./_static/img/11.png" width="100%"/>

The F, A, I and R chapters have a series of questions that follow the same format. The explanatory help text throughout these chapters builds upon [Jacobsen et al (2020) “FAIR Principles: Interpretations and Implementation Considerations”](https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/2/1-2/10/10017/FAIR-Principles-Interpretations-and-Implementation) and reflects also the GO FAIR Foundation’s interpretations which can be accessed at the GO FAIR Foundation’s website: https://www.gofair.foundation/interpretation. This link should help you to understand precisely what type of FAIR Enabling Resource (FER) is being asked for in each case, and for what purpose. Note, in most cases, identical questions are repeated specifically addressing that issue for both data and metadata. In total, there are 12 different FER types, but a FER might be of more than one type (a metadata scheme can also include provenance information and therefore be a FER for F2 and R1.2).

There is a common pattern for each of the questions referring to each FAIR Principles. The questions begin by asking you to make an explicit declaration, about the usage of FAIR Enabling Resources regarding that Principle within your community.

If your community uses a resource that is not FAIR, you have two options:

-   In case your community is not in control of the resource, choose option **a. No Implementations choice** and add the resource as free text in the **Considerations** box (12).

-   In case your community is in control of the resource and plans to FAIRify it, choose **Declaration: FAIR Enabling Resource(s)**, and define that you are going to use it in future (see below).

<img src="./_static/img/12.png" width="100%"/>

If your community uses a resource that has some level of FAIRness, then click option **b.** and add (declare) the FAIR Enabling Resource (or a list of resources) by clicking the **+Add** button (13).

<img src="./_static/img/13.png" width="100%"/>

-   The questionnaire asks you to select (from the drop-down list) a FER for that particular FAIR Principle (14).

<img src="./_static/img/14.png" width="100%"/>

Note: those items in the list that are marked with the GFF qualification logo are quality-checked by the GO FAIR team

<img src="./_static/img/fipwug_ch2_img13sharp.png" width="10%"/>

Others without badges have not yet been quality-checked.

-   Your selection has a follow-up question regarding the usage status of that FER in your community. Is the FER:

    a.  **Currently in use by the community**,

    b.  **Currently in use, but is planned to be replaced in the future**,

    c.  **Is planned to be used in the future**.

Answering **b** will open another text box, allowing you to select the replacement FER.

Lastly, there is a free-text box where you may record the considerations behind your declared choices. These are typically the requirements and constraints your community has identified that factor into the implementation.

Add additional FERs if necessary by clicking the **Add +** button and repeating the cycle.

**Chapter VII. Register a new resource as a nanopublication**

There are 3 cases where you will need to create a new nanopublication before you can complete the FIP questionnaire:

-   creating a new FAIR Implementation Community (FIC),

-   creating a new FAIR Enabling Resource (FER): either by using metadata from FAIRsharing or by creating a new metadata,

-   creating a Metadata Preservation Policy (MPP).

By clicking on the “template” link in each case, you will be taken to the dialog box for creating a new project - in this case, a new Wizard project template for authoring nanopublications.

Once you have successfully created a new nanopublication, it will become immediately visible (and selectable) to you and others in the appropriate drop-down lists of the FIP Wizard 3.0.

## Creating nanopublications

**What is a nanopublication?**

A nanopublication is a unitary assertion about the world with associated metadata, rendered in machine-readable form, and all of this having a globally unique, persistent and resolvable identifier (see [here](https://nanopub.net/) and [here](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-387/)).

![](/docs/img/nanopubstructure.jpg){width="50%"}

Nanopublications are authored using cryptographic keys that make them hard to forge and corrupt. So once published, they are persistent and immutable.

Multiple nanopublications can be “contained” or bundled using a special kind of nanopublication called “index nanopublications”.

**Why nanopublication?**

-   These computational properties of nanopublications can be powerfully leveraged to make machine-readable FIPs.

-   This happens in two ways:

    -   Individual components of the FIP (such as the FIC and FERs) are all represented as nanopublications.

    -   The output of the FIP Wizard 3.0 (see *Publishing your FIP*) is an index nanopublication that provides a list of declared FERs for every FIC.

**How to create FER nanopublications in the FIP Wizard**

1.  Go to *VII. Register a new resource as a nanopublication*

2.  Click on one of the four “template” links

    This takes you to a new project dialog box.

3.  Select the tab: **From Template**

4.  Enter a name for your new nanopub. There is no speciﬁc format required here for the name.

5.  Click **Save**. This will bring you to the questionnaire.

    There are only two chapters:

    -   **Author** - provide your ORCID.
    -   **Deﬁnition** - various details required to build your nanopublication. For Communities you may choose a “supercommunity” to which your community belongs which will help in the analysis of the results. For FERs you have to identify the appropriate FER type. More than one FER type can apply. A FER might be available or 'to be developed'.

    For the name of the resource you are creating you should avoid ‘,’ use a pipe (\|) with a space before and after that symbol (for enabling a better ﬁndability) if you want to add both an acronym and a longer name like **Envthes \| Environmental Thesaurus**

6.  After completing the project, go to **Documents** (15) and make a **new document**.

<img src="./_static/img/15.png" width="50%"/>

7.  For Template choose **Nanopublication Template** and for Format choose **RDF Trig**.

8.  Push **Create**.

    If no error appears you can submit the nanopub clicking on the three dots (16):

9.  Choose **Nanopub Server** (not the local one, which is only for testing) and **submit**.

10. Click on **view submission**.

<img src="./_static/img/16.png" width="20%"/>

You will see the submission as a FER nanopub (17), the persistent identiﬁer (nanopub URI) is highlighted in orange.

![](/docs/img/img17.jpg)

This FER will now appear, automatically, in the drop downs of the question where the FER type is expected (e.g. identiﬁer for F1).

The newly created FER will not yet have a GFF qualiﬁcation, as this review process will take a few days. If it is not accepted you will get a notiﬁcation about the reason.

You can, however, already use the FER before it gets a qualiﬁcation.

## Publishing your FIP

Your completed FIP questionnaire should include:

-   Your community nanopub,

-   The ORCID for the community data steward,

-   All questions completed.

To publish your FIP follow these steps:

1.  Click **Documents** (top menu bar).

2.  Click **New Document** (blue button, right side of upper menu bar).

3.  Be sure to set **Nanopublication Template** and **RDF TriG** to get a machine-readable output.

4.  Click **Create**.

5.  If no error appears you can submit the FIP by clicking on the **three dots**.

6.  Choose **Nanopub Server**.

7.  Click on **view submission**.

You will see the created FIP index nanopub (18)

![](/docs/img/img18.jpg)

If you want to get a human-readable output (19) you could choose as document template:

     I. **Questionnaire Report** which gives you the options to create PDFs or Word documents

     II. **FIP Spreadsheet** to get CSV or Excel files (20)

<img src="./_static/img/19.png" width="40%"/>

<img src="./_static/img/20.png" width="70%"/>

If an error appears (21), you should be aware that all questions must have explicit answers: Some questions may have **null** answers, i.e., declarations that no choice was made.

<img src="./_static/img/21.png" width="100%"/>

By choosing **HTML Preview** of the **Nanopublication Template** (in **Settings** - 22)

<img src="./_static/img/22.png" width="45%"/>

you can see in **Preview mode** the question that needs revision (23).

<img src="./_static/img/23.png" width="50%"/>

Error messages can flag possible issues such as:

-   Missing FAIR Implementation Community

-   Missing or wrong style of ORCID

-   Missing answer

-   Wrong answer (providing text instead of a nanopublication)

-   For some question(s), you did not select a resource

-   For some question(s), you did not select the replacement resource (when option b is selected)

-   For some question(s), the considerations field was left empty

All the nanopublications representing your FIP - i.e., the FIC, the many FERs, and the index nanopub (indeed, all the semantic triples) - will be stored in a dedicated triple store and are available via a [SPARQL endpoint](https://virtuoso.nps.petapico.org/sparql). To get a matrix of all created FIPs, called FIP Matrix (24) download the [new_matrix.csv](https://github.com/peta-pico/dsw-nanopub-api/blob/main/tables/new_matrix.csv).

<img src="./_static/img/24.png" width="55%"/>

## Revising your FIP

Changes in the FIP are automatically saved.

There is no undo button for any action BUT you can use the version history button (25) which allows you to:

-   see all changes done by any editors

-   see details on each activity when clicking on it

-   by clicking on the three dots you see a menu with an option to revert to this version

<img src="./_static/img/25.png" width="40%"/>

If you want to answer a specific question later, click on the **plus button** to get a **TODO reminder** (26).

<img src="./_static/img/26.png" width="100%"/>

Clicking the TODO button you will see all the TODOs as list.

For each question, you can add a comment and replies to that comment which should assist interactions within your team.

After having submitted a document as a nanopublication you might still want to correct your declarations in the FIP and publish a new version. The new nanopublication is recognized as an update of the older submission. This is true also for FER nanopublications which makes it possible to show only the latest version of a specific FER in the drop-down menus for the answers.

A nanopublication is just that - a publication. As such, it is persistent and can not be deleted from the nanopub record. However, as with any traditional publication, nanopublications can be “retracted”. This is done by issuing a special purpose retraction nanopublication, linking to the original. This can only be done by the FIP facilitator. If you feel a nanopublication created in the FIP Wizard should be retracted, please add a new issue in our [qualification github repository](https://github.com/gofair-foundation/fsr_qualification/issues).
