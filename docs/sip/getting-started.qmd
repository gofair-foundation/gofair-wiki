-   You can create SIPs either from scratch or by cloning an existing SIP, and revising it.

**Clone and adapt the SIP project** - By default, you can see only projects you created. To see all projects click on the button where you can see your name and click ‘Clear selection’ (3).

-   Select the tab: **From Project Template**

-   Enter a name for your FIP: We recommend *\[Community acronym\] SIP* (for better findability avoid using '\_' in the name)

-   Add a short description of the FIP

-   Select the **SIP template** from the drop-down list You’ll see different - select **Semantic Interoperability Profile**

-   Later, when minting nanopublications, you'll use the other templates for defining:

-   A FAIR Implementation Community (FIC)

-   A FAIR Supporting Resource from FAIRsharing

-   A FAIR Supporting Resource (FSR)

-   Click **Save**. This will bring you to the SIP questionnaire. You can now start to work with the FIP Wizard questionnaire, and make FIP declarations (see below).

Principally there should be one and only one person who acts as a data steward for the community and enters all answers. However, in most cases the answers will need to be agreed upon by an expert team of that community. By clicking on the **Share button** on the top right you can provide editing or viewing rights for your colleagues (9).
